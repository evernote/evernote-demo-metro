A sample app demonstrating the use of the Evernote API in a Windows 8 Metro style app. 

-----

To use the demo, update EvernoteWrapper/Wrapper.cs with your Evernote API key and TestApp/BlankPage.xaml.cs with your Evernote sandbox username and password.

If you don't have an API key, you can get one at http://dev.evernote.com/documentation/cloud.

-----

The Evernote SDK is contained in the Evernote project, which builds into a class library.

The business logic that exercises the SDK is contained in the EvernoteWrapper project, which builds into a WinMD File.

The C# Metro app uses the APIs exposed by the EvernoteWrapper project to do useful things.
