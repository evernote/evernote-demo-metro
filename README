A sample app demonstrating the use of the Evernote API in a Windows Store (aka Metro Style) app for Windows 8. 

-----

To use the demo, update TestApp/BlankPage.xaml.cs with your Evernote sandbox developer token, which you can get by visiting https://sandbox.evernote.com/api/DeveloperToken.action.

Note that a real application will authenticate using OAuth, which is not demonstrated in this sample. We're merely attempting to demonstrate how to wrap our C# SDK into a Windows Store app.
-----

The Evernote SDK is contained in the Evernote project, which builds into a class library.

The business logic that exercises the SDK is contained in the EvernoteWrapper project, which builds into a WinMD File.

The sample app uses the APIs exposed by the EvernoteWrapper project to do useful things.
